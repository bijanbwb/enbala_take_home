## List Ops

Implement basic list operations.

In functional languages, list operations like `length`, `map`, and
`reduce` are very common. Implement a series of basic list operations,
without using existing functions.

### Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ mix test
```

Or, use the test watcher with:

```bash
$ mix test.watch
```

### Checking typespecs

Verify the typespecs are accurate with:

```bash
$ mix dialyzer
```
